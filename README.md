# Merchandise-Hub
A project for a Python class that attempts to be a sort of "stock manager" for merchandise.


COMPLETED: 
- Beginning of main window: add, edit, remove button added
- Add button going to a new window, having some functionality with a Name, Description, and Price input box
- Save button that shows alert that it saved, although no functionality until edit button is functional

PROBLEMS/BUGS:
- Attempted to create an image preview section in the add button, however it did not work; will have to look into it more at a later time
- After hitting save, main window goes overtop of the add window; not sure yet, but might make it so after hitting save, add window closes, or it will remain open

CHECKLIST or FUTURE IDEAS:
- Firstly, work on the image preview section, and allowing you to add your own images from file explorer
- Next, work on the edit section; will have to make a diagram or pictures of how I would want it to look like
- Then, work on the remove/delete section; will also need to make a diagram or picture of how I want it to look like
- Lastly, polish everything up, and try to get rid of as many bugs/issues as possible
- OPTIONAL: Program it so that all of this could connect to a web server; maybe only for my own personal use or in my own free time will this be done

# Merchandise-Hub
A project for a Python class that attempts to be a sort of "stock manager" for merchandise.


COMPLETED: 
- Beginning of main window: add, edit, remove button added
- Add button going to a new window, having some functionality with a Name, Description, and Price input box
- Save button that shows alert that it saved, and saves everything the user inputted to a .csv file
- Edit button going to a new window, with a buggy (although working) checklist and interface
- Remove button located at the edit section that removes (until you go back to the screen after closing it!)
- Edit button located at the edit section that does make quite the edit, where it removes all of the previous entries that were in the .csv (it would be better to not use .csv or .txt)


PROBLEMS/BUGS:
- Attempted to create an image preview section in the add button, however it would not work and was scrapped entirely. Also wouldn't be able to put images in a .csv anyway.
- After opening the edit/remove section, the message that the delete button is supposed to show ALWAYS POPS UP. Not sure how to fix right now.
- Edit button located in the edit section works as mentioned, but it completely wipes all previous entries. As far as I know, thats the limitation with .csv, and I would have to move to a different way that would require an entire rework. No time left.
- Each entry in the edit section has %'s and ,'s, which I'm also not entirely sure how to rid of. 
- You can remove all the entries you like, but once you close that window and open it back up, they're all back again! The method I used just didn't work very well at all, but it's all I could do at the time.


CHECKLIST or FUTURE IDEAS:
- Rewrite the entire thing. I have learned quite a lot since I first started working on this, and it's already becoming a bunch of spaghetti code and is just a disaster. Also just needs to be approached differently, since all the ideas I had not gotten to were just simply not do-able, or out of my skill level
